In the process of completing homework 5, I learned several important principles of web design.

The Javascript functions that we used were fairly straight forward. These were all methods that I used before, with the exception of the request on load to get the php scripts from the server.

The callback structure that we used was something I had seen before, but not something I was very familiar with so it was good to have more practice with that.

One thing not direcrly related to the project that I learned was how difficult it can be to read code that has a different formatting style. I have one style that is used by my office, and transitioning to code that is written in a different style takes more thought process. It taught me how useful it can be to have a standardized coding style for a development team. 

I'm not great at using comments in my code, but I liked the way we did headers for each section to keep things organized. I think that's a style I will use in the future more often.
